Additional Instructions:

Note: only one project should be running at a time

1.run all the above dependencies under the project directory and only one project should be running at a time

eg. npm install webpack --save (run this command with all the above dependencies with the --save command so that package.json gets update and the dependencies are installed in your project)

2. delete "test" "echo \"Error: no test specified\" && exit 1" inside "scripts" object. We are deleting this line since we will not do any testing in this tutorials. Let's add the start command instead.

"start": "webpack-dev-server --hot"

path:'C:\\Users\\sg0227829\\Documents\\JsonEditor',
